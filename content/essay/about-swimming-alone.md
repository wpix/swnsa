This morning, my to-do list was to finish the discussion part of a draft (or at least write something, anything). And Bang! Here we are. I am writing my first blog post. (Now you can probably tell how much I don’t want to work on the draft, lol). 

<br/>
Q: Why do you say you will never swim alone? <br/>
A: You see, people post fake things online.
<br/>  
Seriously, where does it come from?

**A Pizza Place**

When I was an undergrad, I lived in the dormitory and shared a room with three awesome girls. One of them once worked part-time in a local pizza place where it offered those small cute delicious pizzas with various topping options.

(Speaking of pizza toppings, I think Chinese-style pizza comes with way more choices than US ones. We have fruit pizzas like pineapple, banana, and durian. We even have chocolate pizza. You get the idea.)

The slogan of that pizza place says: Never Swimming Alone. I've always found it interesting but cannot tell you exactly why. It's just weirdly cute.
<br/>

**A Football Club**

It was also during the undergrad, sophomore year, I started dating my ex-boyfriend. He is a huge fan of the Liverpool Football Club. I've never heard of Liverpool before, or I should say I’ve never heard of 99% of the football clubs, even now. One day he posted a photo on Weibo. It was a gate with the decorative letters on the top that reads "You’ll Never Walk Alone," and it turned out to be the gate of the Liverpool Stadium.

I could hardly make the connection between this sentence and the football club. “You’ll never walk alone" is such a romantic commitment while even the idea of Liverpool seems too manly, too massive. Nevertheless, I like this statement. A lot.
<br/>

**A Pink Floyd's Song**

Last summer, when I was in a conference, a friend shared his favorite song with me. Pink Floyd’s _Wish You Were Here_. The lyric says:

> How I wish, how I wish you were here <br/>
> We're just two lost souls swimming in a fishbowl

I immediately fell in love with this song, and had some (maybe too much) thoughts about it. In the beginning, I was sad as it sings I wish you “were” here, meaning in fact you are not. So I am the only lost soul swimming in this fishbowl. Probably two-month after, I suddenly had this idea that “thank goodness you are not here.” It is such a relief knowing that only I got trapped, only I will swim alone, but you are all free.

_I wish you were here, and I am glad that you are not._

And then, I realized I should just stop paying too much attention to the grammar.
<br/>

**All in all**

Don’t you think “You’ll Never Swim Alone” fits the Liverpool club better? After all, It’s liverPOOL.
